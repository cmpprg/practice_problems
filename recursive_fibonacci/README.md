# Recursive Fibonacci

This is an exploration of recursion.  I used the fibonacci sequence as my problem to solve.  I ended up using two different methods to solve the problem, one that looks like a very classic representation of recursion, the other is something I found online and played with until I understood it. The second method utilized the ability to set hash defaults using a block. It was fun, please comment or reach out if you have any feedback for me.  

Have a great day!
