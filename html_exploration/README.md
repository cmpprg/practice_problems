# HTML(Hyper-Text Markup Language) Exploration

My intention with this exploration is to create a reference script for HTML. To help facilitate this I will be taking a 2-3 hour course on LinkedIn Learning. While going through the course I will be using this script as a sort of notes page for the elements that I learn along the way.  

As always, I encourage you to leave me feedback in the form of issues or comments. You can also reach out on LinkedIn @ https://www.linkedin.com/in/campprg/  

Have a great day!
