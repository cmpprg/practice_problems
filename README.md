# Practice Problems

I will be using this repo to store all of my non-deployed / practice scripts.  
I hope to explore different topics, such as linked lists and binary trees in this repo.  
Feel free to look around, fork if you feel like it, or take snippets of anything.  
If you have any feedback for me on anyting you see please reach out by issue, comments, or link up with me @ https://www.linkedin.com/in/campprg/  

Have a great day!!
